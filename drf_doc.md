# A step by step guide to  Django rest framework

- creating a virtuel env `py -m venv en_name`
- creating django `pip install django version`
- create a  requirement file  `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Install django rest framework     `pip install djangorestframework`
- Verify that django is installed `py -m django --version`
- check the restframework installation `rest_framework.__version__` in the python shell
- create a django project     `django-admin startproject project_name`
- Open the settings.py file in your project directory add `rest_framework`  to the INSTALLED_APPS section to include Django REST Framework in your project
- Create a new app `python manage.py startapp app_nane`
-  in the settings.py file of your project. Open the settings.py file and add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS
- Making Migrations: After defining your models, you need to create migrations for them. `python manage.py makemigrations` `py manage.py migrate`
- To add your model to the Django admin interface, you need to register the model in the admin.py file of your app `admin.site.register(model_name)`
- Create a super user using the following pattern `py manage.py createsupersuser`
- If you need to undo a migration, you can use the migrate command with the name of the app and the migration you want to revert to `python manage.py migrate myapp 0001`

## Create a Serializer

Serializers in Django REST Framework are responsible for converting complex data types, such as querysets and model instances, to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types. They also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first validating the incoming data.

Here’s how to create and work with serializers effectively:

Understanding Serializers: Think of serializers in Django REST Framework as similar to Django Forms. Like forms, serializers handle both the conversion of data to and from Python datatypes and validation of incoming data. They are an essential component in a Django REST API for data handling.

Define Your Serializer: In your Django app, create a new file named serializers.py. This is where you will define your serializers. For each model, you typically create a corresponding serializer. For example, if you have a BlogPost model, you can create a BlogPostSerializer:    `from rest_framework import serializers`

Field Types in Serializers: Just like models, serializers can define various field types. The Django REST Framework provides a set of field classes that map closely to Django’s model fields (like CharField, IntegerField, etc.). You can also define custom fields for more complex data handling.

Validation in Serializers: Serializers also handle validation. You can define custom validation methods for your serializer fields or override the .validate() method to add any specific validation logic for your serializer.

Nested Serializers: Sometimes, you might need to include related objects in your serialized output. Django REST Framework allows you to nest serializers within each other. For example, if your BlogPost model has a foreign key to a User model, you can create a UserSerializer and include it in your BlogPostSerializer.

Read-Only and Write-Only Fields: In some cases, you might want certain fields to be read-only or write-only. This can be specified in your serializer fields using the read_only=True or write_only=True arguments.

Using Serializers in Views: Once you have defined your serializers, you will use them in your views to handle the incoming and outgoing data. Serializers will convert querysets and model instances to JSON data that can be returned in HTTP responses, and they will also handle parsing and validating JSON data sent by clients.

By following these steps, you create a bridge between your complex data types (like model instances) and the JSON data that is sent and received in your API. Serializers are a powerful feature of Django REST Framework that streamline the process of data serialization and deserialization, making it easier to build robust and efficient APIs.

## Creating API Views in Django

Step 7: Set Up ViewsPermalink
In Django REST Framework, views are where you define the logic of your API. They determine how to process incoming requests and return responses. For a RESTful API, you typically need to handle various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. In Django, these methods are referred to as actions. The actions include list, create, retrieve, update, and destroy. Here’s how to set up your views effectively, including examples for each of these methods:

Understanding ViewSets: Django REST Framework introduces the concept of ViewSets, which are classes that provide the logic for handling requests. They are a high-level abstraction over the traditional Django views and are particularly suited for standard database operations. They reduce the amount of code you need to write to create API endpoints.

Creating a ViewSet: In your views.py file, you can create a ViewSet for your model. For example, if you have a BlogPost model and a corresponding BlogPostSerializer, your ViewSet might look like this:

## Configure URL Routing 

Here’s how to configure URL routing effectively:

Understanding Django URL Dispatcher: In Django, the URL dispatcher is used to direct HTTP requests to the appropriate view based on the request URL. It uses a URLconf, which is a set of patterns that Django tries to match the requested URL to find the right view.

Setting Up URL Patterns: In your Django project’s urls.py file (located in the project’s main directory), you will include the URL patterns for your app. First, you need to import the necessary functions and include your app’s URLs. 

RL Patterns for ViewSets: When you use a router, it automatically generates the URL patterns for the standard actions in your viewsets (like list, create, retrieve, update, and destroy). For example, the BlogPostViewSet will have URL patterns for listing all blog posts, retrieving a single blog post, creating a new blog post, etc.

Custom URL Patterns: If you have custom actions in your viewsets (like the like action in the previous example), the router will also generate appropriate URL patterns for these actions.

Namespacing URL Patterns: If your project contains multiple apps, it’s a good practice to namespace your URL patterns. This means including the app’s URLs under a specific namespace:

This allows you to reverse URLs unambiguously in templates and view functions.

Testing Your URLs: After setting up your URL patterns, you should test them to ensure they correctly map to your views. Django’s shell and test framework can be useful for testing URL configurations.

URL Design Considerations: When designing your URLs, consider RESTful principles. For instance, use simple, readable URLs that reflect the nature of the data being accessed or manipulated. Also, use nouns instead of verbs in your URL paths (e.g., /blogposts/ instead of /get_blogposts/).

By configuring your URL routing properly, you ensure that your Django REST API is well-structured and that each endpoint is correctly mapped to its corresponding view. This step is crucial for the functionality of your API, as it defines how clients interact with your application and access its resources.

Step 9: Implement Authentication and PermissionsPermalink
In building a robust Django REST API, implementing authentication and permissions is a critical step. This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints, and users can only perform actions they’re permitted to. Django REST Framework provides a flexible authentication and permissions system that can be tailored to your needs.

Here’s how to implement authentication and permissions effectively:

Understanding Authentication and Permissions: Authentication determines the identity of a user, while permissions determine if an authenticated user has access to perform a certain action. Django REST Framework supports various authentication schemes like Basic Authentication, Token Authentication, and OAuth.

Setting Up Authentication: To set up authentication, you need to choose an authentication scheme and configure it in your Django settings. For example, to set up Token Authentication, you first need to add 'rest_framework.authtoken' to your INSTALLED_APPS and run python manage.py migrate to create the necessary database tables. Then, in your settings.py, add:

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
	'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
    	'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
	],
}
Implementing Permissions: Permissions are used to grant or deny access to different parts of your API. In your views, you can set permission classes to control access. Django REST Framework provides a set of built-in permission classes like IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, and IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly. For example:

from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework import viewsets

class BlogPostViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
	permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
	# rest of the viewset code
This will ensure that only authenticated users can access the endpoints defined in BlogPostViewSet.

Custom Permissions: If the built-in permissions don’t fit your needs, you can define custom permission classes. A custom permission class is a Python class that extends rest_framework.permissions.BasePermission and overrides the .has_permission() and/or .has_object_permission() methods.

Token Generation and Handling: For token-based authentication, when a user logs in, a token is generated and sent back to the user. This token must be included in the Authorization header of HTTP requests to access protected endpoints.

Securing Sensitive Information: Be cautious with sensitive information. Ensure that tokens and credentials are transmitted securely, preferably over HTTPS. Also, be mindful of storing sensitive data on the client side.

Testing Authentication and Permissions: It’s important to test your API’s authentication and permissions to ensure that they are working as expected. You can write tests to check if the API responds correctly to authenticated and unauthenticated requests, and if the permissions are correctly enforced.

Third-Party Packages for Extended Functionality: If you need more advanced authentication features, like OAuth or social authentication, you can use third-party packages like django-rest-auth or django-allauth.

By implementing authentication and permissions, you add a layer of security to your Django REST API, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify data. This is a crucial aspect of any API, especially when dealing with sensitive or personal data.

Step 10: Thoroughly Test Your APIPermalink
Testing your Django REST API is an essential step to ensure its functionality, reliability, and security. It involves a series of checks and validations to make sure that your API behaves as expected under various conditions. Here’s an expanded guide on how to thoroughly test your API:

Start Your Development Server: Before testing, you need to run your development server. Use the command python manage.py runserver in your terminal. This will start the server, typically accessible at http://localhost:8000/.

Manual Testing with Browser and Tools: Initially, you can perform manual testing by visiting endpoints in your browser. For example, navigate to http://localhost:8000/blogposts/ to test your blog posts API. For more complex requests (like POST, PUT, DELETE), or to test headers and authentication, use tools like Postman or cURL. These tools allow you to craft specific HTTP requests and inspect the responses.

Automated Testing: Automated testing is crucial for maintaining long-term quality and reliability. Django’s test framework allows you to write test cases in Python. Create a tests.py file in your app directory and write test classes that inherit from django.test.TestCase. Test different aspects of your API, including:

Testing HTTP Methods: Write tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Ensure that your API responds with the correct status codes and data.
Authentication and Permissions: If your API uses authentication, write tests to verify that unauthenticated requests are properly rejected and that users have the correct permissions for different actions.
Edge Cases and Error Handling: Test how your API handles invalid inputs, unexpected request formats, and other edge cases. Your API should respond with appropriate error messages and status codes.
Writing a Sample Test Case: Here’s an example of a test case for creating a blog post:

from django.urls import reverse
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.test import APITestCase
from .models import BlogPost

class BlogPostTests(APITestCase):
	def test_create_blogpost(self):
    	"""
    	Ensure we can create a new blog post.
    	"""
    	url = reverse('blogpost-list')
    	data = {'title': 'Test Post', 'content': 'Test content'}
    	response = self.client.post(url, data, format='json')
    	self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
    	self.assertEqual(BlogPost.objects.count(), 1)
    	self.assertEqual(BlogPost.objects.get().title, 'Test Post')
Continuous Integration (CI): Implementing CI practices, such as using GitHub Actions or Jenkins, can help automate the testing process. These tools can run your test suite on every push or pull request, ensuring that changes do not break existing functionality.

Performance Testing: If your API is expected to handle high traffic, conduct performance testing. Tools like Apache JMeter or Locust can simulate multiple users accessing your API to identify performance bottlenecks.

Security Testing: Ensure your API is secure against common vulnerabilities. This includes testing for SQL injection, data leaks, and proper authentication and authorization checks.

Documentation and Test Cases: Keep your test cases well-documented. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for understanding the expected behavior of your API and can be particularly helpful for new developers joining the project.

By following these steps and regularly running tests, you can catch bugs early, prevent regressions, and maintain the overall health of your Django REST API. Remember, a well-tested API is a cornerstone of a reliable and trustworthy application.
